# Projects

Organised project directories for Clawd's work.

## Structure

```
projects/
├── kanban/         # Task tracking board
└── ...             # Future projects
```

## Conventions

Each project gets its own directory with:
- `README.md` - What it is, how to use it
- `src/` - Source code (if applicable)
- `data/` - Data files, exports, backups
- `docs/` - Additional documentation (if needed)
